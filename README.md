# Outfit-Planner-Project
WRSPM and Code

Our team has chosen to create a dress-up game that allows users to customize an avatar with a variety of clothing and accessories. The purpose of the game is to provide a fun and creative way for users to express themselves by trying different styles and outfit combinations. Users will be able to select from different categories such as tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories. We plan to design our own unique clothing and accessory artwork. 
Users will have to sign up for an account and log in. After creating their own account, users will be able to save their outfits, view them in the gallery, rate them, generate random outfits, and they can reset the avatar to start fresh and experiment with new looks. The game is designed to be easy to use with account logins to keep user creations protected.
